React Storefront (RSF) is a standalone responsive PWA storefront for your eCommerce websites that works with any eCommerce platform or backend system. React storefront extends Next.js to include everything you need for an eCommerce storefront. Try <a href="https://www.thetiebar.com/">The Tie Bar</a>, <a href="https://www.shopakira.com/">Akira</a>, and <a href="https://pwa.www.1800flowers.com/">1-800-FLOWERS.COM</a> on your phone to see how fast sites on RSF can be!

## Ludicrous Speed

React Storefront goes the extra mile to squeeze speed out of every possible real and user perceived performance optimization including:

- High cache hit rates for dynamic data
- Server Side Rendering
- Automatic AMP creation
- Predictive prefetching of dynamic data
- Code splitting
- Cache optimization
- Client data reuse
- Skeletons
- and more

Bottom Line: RSF is built for speed!

## A Different Approach

React Storefront takes a bold new approach that values developer productivity so you can get more done in less time:

- No config -- download and start coding
- Opinionated framework that does the heavy lifting for you
- Unified code base that uses isomorphic JavaScript across the server, client, and CDN
- Generate AMP and PWA from a single code base
- Automatically guides developers into performance best practices
- Supports source maps for Chrome Debugger and Visual Studio Code

React Storefront is and always will be open source. Anyone can use and support the project, we want it to be a tool to improve the online shopping experience for everyone.

The project is in the **production ready** phase. Already supporting live retailer sites with 10M$ + to 1B$+ in annual eCommerce revenue!

**We are looking for Contributors and Designers willing to help us in the solution development.**

## Integrations

React Storefront can be easily integrated with any eCommerce platform by [implementing the synthetic API](https://pwa.moovweb.com/guides/calling_apis). To make life easier we're preparing some out-of-the-box integrations. Currently we support **BigCommerce** out of the box. More platforms to come soon!

## How to get started?

You can create a local copy of the demo site using `create-react-storefront` to use as a starting point for your own site:

```
npm install -g create-react-storefront
create-react-storefront my-site
npm run start:express
```

<a href="https://pwa.moovweb.com">Read the Tutorial.</a>
Check out [the source code of the demo site](https://github.com/react-storefront-community/react-storefront-boilerplate).

## Development

If you like to contribute please feel free to **Raise an issue** with a bug or feature request report, or just open a **Pull Request** with the proposed changes. In any case [read the CONTRIBUTING.md first](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

Please feel invited to join our React Storefront Community!

## Local development

After cloning the repo, run:

```
npm i
```

To use your local clone of react-storefront in projects, use `yalc`.

To publish react-storefront to your local yalc store:

```
yalc publish
```

Then run the following to push updated builds to yalc store on changes.

```
npm run watch
```

Finally, in your project run:

```
yalc add react-storefront
```

This will change your project's package.json to use a file path in the dependency entry for react-storefront. To revert this change, run:

```
yalc remove react-storefront # or yalc remove --all
npm i
```

Our short and mid-term plans include:

- adding alternative production build and deployment options,
- optimize the UI layer,
- long term plan - to port <a href="https://storefrontui.io">Storefront UI</a> to React and use it in the project.

## Documentation

The documentation is always THE HARDEST PART of each open source project! But we're trying hard :-)
[Full Guides, API Documentation, and Examples](https://docs.react-storefront.io/)

## The business challenges

React Storefront was created to solve a set of key business challenges from the world of the shopping experience. Our goal is to provide the following solutions:

- An ultrafast front-end for the store- with the PWA approach we can now render the catalog of products within milliseconds;
- Endurance for traffic overloads on the store;
- Off-line shopping capabilities;
- A smooth shopping experience, similar to that of a native mobile application;
- An all-in-one front-end for desktop and mobile devices with no necessity for maintaining 3 or more applications for different touchpoints (web browser, Android, iOS etc.).
- Rapid development without architecture limitations.

A free tier is available. Inquire through Moovweb's website.

## Partners

RSF was created by a group of eCommerce site, eCommerce agency, and eCommerce platform engineers.

Partners are encouraged to support the project in various ways - mostly by contributing to the source code, marketing activities, evangelizing and of course - implementing the production projects. We do support our partners by dedicated contact channels, workshops and by sharing the leads from merchants interested in implementations.
