React Storefront is a standalone PWA storefront for your eCommerce, possible to connect with any eCommerce backend (through the API). BigCommerce is officialy supported. <a href="">Read the full story.</a>

Crafted with ❤️ by <a href="https://moovweb.com">Moovweb</a> and developed with <a href="https://vuestorefront.io">Vue Storefront</a> team.

## Ludicrous Speed

React Storefront goes the extra mile to squeeze speed out of every possible real and user perceived performance optimization including:
- Server Side Rendering
- Automatic AMP creation
- Predictive prefetching
- Code splitting
- Cache optimization
- Client data reuse
- Skeletons
- and more

Bottom Line: sub-second page loads that are unmatched in the industry!

## A Different Approach

React Storefront takes a bold new approach that values developer productivity so you can get more done in less time:

- No config -- download and start coding
- Opinionated framework that does the heavy lifting for you
- Unified code base that uses isomorphic Javascript across server, client, and CDN
- Generate AMP and PWA from a single code base
- Automatically guides developers into performance best practices
- Supports source maps for Chrome Debugger and Visual Studio Code

React Storefront is and always will be in the open source. Anyone can use and support the project, we want it to be a tool for the improvement of the shopping experience.

The project is in the **production ready** phase. Already supporting sites from 10M$+ to 1B$+ on production!

**We are looking for Contributors and Designer willing to help us in the solution development.**

## React Storefront vs. Vue Storefront

React Storefront is being developed by <a href="https://moovweb.com">Moovweb</a> and <a href="https://vuestorefront.io">Vue Storefront</a> teams. The architecture differs from <a href="https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront">Vue Storefront</a> project and the purpose is wider.

React Storefront’s architecture is pretty much open, it’s simple. It lets you use the **parts of a legacy page**, add **caching**, **AMP rendering** and **PWA features**. You can do the whole site from scratch as well. It won’t even be necessary be an eCommerce site. We love this openness. **We created this forked repository and applied Vue Storefront-like branding in order to show our dedication to this new storefront Family Member.**

## Integrations

React Storefront can be easily integrated with any eCommerce platform by [implementing the synthetic API](https://pwa.moovweb.com/guides/calling_apis). To make life easier we're preparing some out-of-the-box integrations. Currently we support **BigCommerce** out of the box. More platforms to come soon!

## The business challenges

Vue Storefront was created to solve a set of key business challenges from the world of the shopping experience. Our goal for the application is to provide the solution with:

- The ultrafast front-end for the store - with the PWA approach we can now render the catalog of products within milliseconds;
- The endurance for traffic overloads on the store;
- The off-line shopping capabilities;
- The smooth shopping experience close to the user experience from the native mobile applications;
- The all-in-one front-end for desktop and mobile screens with no necessity for maintaining 3 or more applications for different touchpoints (web browser, Android, iOS etc.).
- Rapid development without architecture limitations.
