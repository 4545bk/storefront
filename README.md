React Storefront a standalone PWA storefront for your eCommerce websites that works with any eCommerce platform or backend system.

Crafted with ❤️ by <a href="https://www.moovweb.com">Moovweb</a>. Developed with <a href="https://divante.com">Divante</a> team and the Community.
Our goal is to build a vibrant open source community around the project and solid PWA framework React developers will love :)

## Ludicrous Speed

React Storefront goes the extra mile to squeeze speed out of every possible real and user perceived performance optimization including:
- Server Side Rendering
- Automatic AMP creation
- Predictive prefetching
- Code splitting
- Cache optimization
- Client data reuse
- Skeletons
- and more

Bottom Line: sub-second page loads that are unmatched in the industry!

## A Different Approach

React Storefront takes a bold new approach that values developer productivity so you can get more done in less time:

- No config -- download and start coding
- Opinionated framework that does the heavy lifting for you
- Unified code base that uses isomorphic JavaScript across the server, client, and CDN
- Generate AMP and PWA from a single code base
- Automatically guides developers into performance best practices
- Supports source maps for Chrome Debugger and Visual Studio Code

React Storefront is and always will be open source. Anyone can use and support the project, we want it to be a tool to improve  the online shopping experience for everyone.

The project is in the **production ready** phase. Already supporting live retailer sites with 10M$ + to 1B$+ in annual eCommerce revenue!

**We are looking for Contributors and Designers willing to help us in the solution development.**

## Integrations

React Storefront can be easily integrated with any eCommerce platform by [implementing the synthetic API](https://pwa.moovweb.com/guides/calling_apis). To make life easier we're preparing some out-of-the-box integrations. Currently we support **BigCommerce** out of the box. More platforms to come soon!

<a href="https://github.com/moovweb/BigCommerce"><img src="https://divante.com/github/react-storefront/BC%20Supported.png" alt="BigCommerce is officialy supported"/></a>

## How to get started?

You can create a local copy of the demo site using `create-react-storefront` to use as a starting point for your own site:

```
npm install -g create-react-storefront
create-react-storefront my-site
npm run start:express
```

Our short and mid-term plans include:
- adding alternative production build and deployment options,
- optimize the UI layer,
- long term plan - to port <a href="https://storefrontui.io">Storefront UI</a> to React and use it in the project.

## Documentation

The documentation is always THE HARDEST PART of each open source project! But we're trying hard :-)

## The business challenges

React Storefront was created to solve a set of key business challenges from the world of the shopping experience. Our goal is to provide the following solutions:

- An ultrafast front-end for the store- with the PWA approach we can now render the catalog of products within milliseconds;
- Endurance for traffic overloads on the store;
- Off-line shopping capabilities;
- A smooth shopping experience, similar to that of a native mobile application;
- An all-in-one front-end for desktop and mobile devices with no necessity for maintaining 3 or more applications for different touchpoints (web browser, Android, iOS etc.).
- Rapid development without architecture limitations.

## Support us!

## Works best on Moovweb CDN

React Storefront runs best on <a href="https://www.moovweb.com">the Moovweb XDN</a>
Moovweb provides a serverless platform-as-a-service called the XDN (Experience Delivery Network) that is available for purchase. The XDN helps developers optimize speed across the entire stack to deliver dynamic websites that load in a blink of the eye. Features that are available for purchase are listed are tagged with "XDN" in the table of contents.

## React Storefront and Vue Storefront

This project has been created by Moovweb. Divante has recently joined and we decided to open it and develop towards general purpose PWA framework. Divante folks created <a href="https://vuestorefront.io">Vue Storefront</a> - the most popular PWA framework for eCommerce and Vue.js.

The products, despite the common name are totally different at this point.

Our goal joining the forces is to build a vibrant community. We started the cooperation with the natural step of adding BigCommerce support to the framework. Both React and BigCommerce were not available in the frameworks we used yet! The next steps are to work on providing the different deployment options, to optimize the UI and to hear your feedback and improve the product!

PS: Check [StorefrontUI](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/storefront-ui/) - our UI library for eCommerce. We plan to port it from Vue.js to React in the nearest future
